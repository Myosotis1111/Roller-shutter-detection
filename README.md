# Python project：

- # The folder "[detection_platform](https://git.mylab.th-luebeck.de/xinchen.yang/building-management-machine-vision/-/tree/main/detection_platform)" contains all the source codes used in this bachelor thesis.

The python project （see folder “**detection_platform**”） is packed using conda. Users can download the folder (please make sure there is **at least 8GB** available in the disk Anaconda installed), import to IDE and follow three steps to configure the environment:

**(1) Use Conda to create a new environment**. Run the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

    conda env create -f environment.yaml

This will create a new Conda environment using the configuration in the environment.yaml file.

**(2)** After the environment is created successfully, **activate the newly created environment.** Run the following command:

    conda activate rs_detection

**(3)** Finally, **change the Python interpreter** of the program to the interpreter in the conda environment you just created. The project can then be run via **main.py**.

# Additional modules

**Folder "preprocessing" and "Extra Functions" are not related to the grading of the bachelor thesis.** They serve as supportive codes for data preprocessing and software optimization.
