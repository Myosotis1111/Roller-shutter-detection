    \paragraph{Acknowledgments by Horst Hellbrück}
    I want to thank all staff members and students that have participated in this document by giving tips or by asking questions. When I have started this guide in 2009 with a vague idea in mind, I could not foresee that this document becomes such a great help for all the students. My special thanks go to Zhi Haolin and Ren Zhong from the international study program \programname{} at \universityname{} together with ECUST in Shanghai. They have written most of the texts and provided references and figures. Without their valuable contribution this guide would have stayed at a conceptual level.
    
    \paragraph{Acknowledgements by Ren Zhong}
    I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Dr.-Ing Horst Hellbrück, who wrote the first draft of this document, and offered me such a great opportunity to contribute to this meaningful work.
    
    \paragraph{Acknowledgements by Andreas Hanemann}
    I would like to thank the people who have worked on this document earlier (Horst Hellbrück, Zhi Haolin, Aida Bahta, Ren Zhong). Some advice from Hermann Hochhaus and Hans-Günter Kunze has also been included into the document.
    
    \paragraph{Acknowledgements by Denys Matthies}
    I would like to particularly thank Martin Ochoa, Vel, Johannes Böttcher, Steve Gunn, Sunil Patand, and Benjamin Petry for providing the basis for this new layout. Thank you!
    
    \paragraph{} The authors hope that students can benefit from the document and that more students may add contributions to this document to improve it.
